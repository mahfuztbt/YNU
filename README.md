# During my undergraduate studies, I completed 78 courses, earning 168 credits in subjects including Math, Physics, Sports, and Chinese. Unfortunately, I didn't upload all my programming work to GitHub at that time, and I later lost most of it. Fortunately, I did manage to upload some of the work. ## Below, I have listed the relevant GitHub repositories.### [Software Training](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/Software-Training-SOFT3N0060) <br/><br/>### [Software Design Pattern](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/Software-Design-Pattern-Spring-2021) <br/><br/>### [Innovative Design](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/Innovative-Design-Spring-2021) <br/><br/>### [Machine Leaning and Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/zhaomingxiong-laoshi-spring-2021/tree/master/ML%20%26%20AL) <br/><br/>### [New Technology Edge](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/zhaomingxiong-laoshi-spring-2021/tree/master/New%20Tech%20Edge) <br/><br/>### [Software Engineering](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/Course-Selection-System-Fall-2020/blob/main/20183290375_MD%20MAHFUZUR%20RAHMAN%20%E6%AF%92%E6%B6%B2.pdf) <br/><br/>### [Java Programming Language](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/OO_java_homework_ynu) <br/><br/>### [Mathmatical Foundation of Data Science](https://github.com/mahfuztbt/Mathmatical-Foundation-of-Data-Science) <br/><br/>
